      <h2>Key Value of the Invention</h2>
      <p>
        Rural hosts have another operation to tend to other than 
        their short-term rentals. They are <b>ranchers, farmers, homesteaders,
        and the like.</b> When deciding today's tasks, they 
        do not need an overcomplicated, immobile system.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cabin Kingdom solves one simple question, for <b>BOTH</b> guests <b>AND</b> hosts:
        <br>
        <b>What's going on today in the Kingdom?</b>
      </p>

      <h2>Pain Points</h2>
      <p>
        The following are the most annoying questions a typical rural host
        receives on the daily.

        <b>Which cabins do you have available this weekend?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Rural hosts get stuck in a cycle of: 
        <br>
        → receive a last minute guest phone call <br>
        → leave the field <br>
        → get to a computer <br>
        → figure out what cabins are open <br>
        → call the guest back and waste time talking them through the available options <br> 
        → go back to the field <br>
        → aaand receive another phone call from a guest!
        <br>
        <br>
        When it is possible to instead...
        <br>
        → receive a phone call 
        <br>
        → send the guest a comprehensive link!
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card ck-card">
      <p>
        <b>Which cabin needs what today?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Rural hosts often hire temporary workers, who may be there anywhere a few weeks to
        a few months. The faster these workers can be onboarded, the more they can do
        in their short tenure. The management system needs to be temporary worker friendly.
        Unlike at organizations that hire long term, it's not useful to keep track of 
        separate worker accounts here.
        A single tracker page for all workers to view is
        the winning ticket.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is where the dual purpose of Cabin Kingdom begins to shine. The same landing page is 
        of value to guests and workers alike. Without needing to login, workers can immediately 
        see the cabin occupation schedule and know which cabins need today's focus. For a more detailed
        look, workers can log into the cleaning page.
